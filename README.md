#DataScienceII

This repo is a set of programs reflecting some of the data science methods and topics I learned during the fall of 2017.

Included are:
1. a logistic regression binary document classifier with weights learned via gradient decent
2. a logistic regression binary document classifier with weights learned via a simple genetic programming algorithm
3. an implementation of the [MultiRankWalk algorithm](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/research/reports/2009/cmulti09017.pdf)
4. an implementation of a stochastic Singular Value Decomposition solver.
